# Neural Network from Scratch

A neural network framework implemented in Python, supporting various activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers for classification and regression tasks.

## 🚀 Features

- Custom Dense layers with configurable activation types (ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, softmax)
- Multiple loss functions (MSE, Binary Crossentropy, Categorical Crossentropy)
- Gradient descent optimizer with learning rate decay and momentum
- Modular design for easy extension and experimentation

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy

The tanh_implementation.py file is still in progress and testing systems will be completed in further updates

main.py is a fully functional file and demonstrates the application of the Softmax activation with Adam Optimizer as the optimization.
